This project was created by Chris Canal and Cameron Billings.
We ordered some digital LED lights from China and covered our
apartment with them. We are going to control the lights via
some sensors and Google Home and Alexa. There will be videos
to accompany this tutorial as well. Thanks for checking out
our project!
